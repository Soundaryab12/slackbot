# slackbot
A Slack Bot that messages all members of a team using Python, pip and virtualenv. I wanted to do this with my workspace and found no direct way of doing it, so thought of creating one myself.  

Here is the Medium article where I have explained the steps of how I created the bot: https://medium.com/@poojabalasubramani/how-to-create-a-slack-bot-that-messages-all-members-of-a-workspace-in-8-minutes-32a5b52838be. 

Hope it is clear!
